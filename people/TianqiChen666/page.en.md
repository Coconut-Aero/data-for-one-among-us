## Description

As a witness of the transition from the old to the new on Twitter (now X), Ms. Menma had been active in the Chinese section of Twitter (now X) since registering her account in September 2022. While sharing rich details of her personal life, she also delved into her thoughts on her roles in her own life, her family, and society.

She kept moving forward on the journey of exploring her own identity, a journey full of ups and downs. But even though she felt trapped on this journey, she never stopped her self-exploration. The postcards and letters she sent not only expressed her care and love for others but also left precious footprints for her own self-discovery.

Throughout her journey of self-exploration, Menma maintained a learning attitude and an enterprising spirit, always treating other users in the Chinese community with her consistent cheerfulness. At the same time, her thoughts remained pure, and she always presented herself with a consistent attitude. She brought joy to everyone in the Chinese community with her memes, yet carried all the pressures of life, family, and relationships on her own shoulders.

Menma completed her self-awareness and exploration today. I hope you will remember her wishes and actively care for those around you. At the same time, we will continue to move forward and fulfill Ms. Menma’s unfinished hopes and dreams for a better life.

## Their Departure and Our Memorial

Ms. Menma brought joy to everyone, but her body and mind were tortured. She suffered from diabetes, high blood sugar, hair loss, gray hair, and fatty liver caused by complications of several diseases. At the same time, due to the oppressive family environment, her journey of self-exploration was always shrouded in uncertainty. She tried many ways to resist the pressure from her family, but eventually, she was overwhelmed.Under the constant surveillance of her mother and the pressures of life, after completing her national trip, she took a lethal dose of a drug solution. Many users from the Chinese Twitter community accompanied her in this final moment, and she fell asleep forever.

Our dear Ms. Menma passed away from sodium nitrite poisoning in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, in the early hours of February 26, 2025, at the age of 19.
